# Reuse-Vandy
Repository for CS 4278 - Principles of Software Engineering Group 15

## Project Inspiration
This is a project designed to replace the anitquated ReuseVandy GroupMe with a user-friendly mobile application.
This will allow for better searching, visibility, and connection between buyers and sellers.

## Framework
We will be using ReactNative for the frontend with a NodeJS backend connected to a relational database (likely Postgress but not finalized yet)
The app will be hosted on Expo

## Git Best Practices
1. A new branch will be created for each portion of the sprint
2. NO WORK WILL BE DONE ON THE MAIN BRANCH
3. All commits will have informative and easy to understand messages
4. PRs will need to be reviewed by at least one other team member
5. Commit early and often, there shouldn't be any pull requests with only one commit
